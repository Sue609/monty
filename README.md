A stack and a queue are two fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming. Here's a brief description of each:

Stack:

A stack is an ordered collection of elements where the addition and removal of elements follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
It operates like a stack of plates, where you can only access the topmost plate and can either add a new plate on top (push) or remove the topmost plate (pop).
The elements in a stack are typically accessed in a "last in, first out" order, meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.
Common operations on a stack include push (add an element to the top), pop (remove the top element), peek (access the top element without removing it), and isEmpty (check if the stack is empty).
Queue:

A queue is an ordered collection of elements where the addition of elements is done at one end (rear) and the removal of elements is done from the other end (front).
It operates like a queue of people waiting in line, where the person who arrives first is served first (First-In-First-Out or FIFO principle).
The elements in a queue are typically accessed in a "first in, first out" order, meaning the element that has been in the queue the longest is the first one to be removed.
Common operations on a queue include enqueue (add an element to the rear), dequeue (remove the front element), peek (access the front element without removing it), and isEmpty (check if the queue is empty).
Stacks and queues are widely used in various applications and algorithms. Understanding their properties and operations is crucial in solving many programming problems efficiently.
